Nearest Neighbour applied for bundle segmentation 

- Tractogram dataset organized into tree data structure, i.e.kd-tree
- KNN (k nearest neighbour) search performed to extract bundle from the tractogram.
 
Experiment provided here is for one example tract to segment the same tract from tractogram.

Requirements:

pykdtree
(https://github.com/storpipfugl/pykdtree)

you may use KDTree implementation from scipy or sklearn
